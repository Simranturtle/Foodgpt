# Foodgpt
Dataset is free available at Kaggle.
This dataset comprises images of various fruits and vegetables, including:

**Fruits:** banana, apple, pear, grapes, orange, kiwi, watermelon, pomegranate, pineapple, mango.

**Vegetables:** cucumber, carrot, capsicum, onion, potato, lemon, tomato, radish, beetroot, cabbage, lettuce, spinach, soybean, cauliflower, bell pepper, chili pepper, turnip, corn, sweetcorn, sweet potato, paprika, jalape√±o, ginger, garlic, peas, eggplant.

The dataset is organized into three main folders:

1. **Training Data:** This folder contains 100 images for each food item, split into subfolders based on the specific food type.

2. **Testing Data:** In this folder, you'll find 10 images for each food item, separated into subfolders corresponding to the food category.

3. **Validation Data:** Similar to the testing data, this folder contains 10 images per food item, categorized by food type.

This dataset is intended for training and evaluating machine learning models, particularly for tasks related to food recognition or object detection within the domain of fruits and vegetables.
I have VGG16,model for classification and YOLO for object detection , then using prompt engineering made a Foodgpt, where after classification and detection , one can get information of food's calories,nutrition and recipes.
